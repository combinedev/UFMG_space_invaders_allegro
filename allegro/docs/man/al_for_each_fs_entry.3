\f[C]
#include <allegro5/allegro.h>

int al_for_each_fs_entry(ALLEGRO_FS_ENTRY *dir,
                         int (*callback)(ALLEGRO_FS_ENTRY *dir, void *extra),
                         void *extra)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This function takes the ALLEGRO_FS_ENTRY(3) \f[V]dir\f[R], which should
represent a directory, and looks for any other file system entries that
are in it.
This function will then call the callback function \f[V]callback\f[R]
once for every filesystem entry in the directory \f[V]dir\f[R].
.PP
The callback \f[V]callback\f[R] must be of type
\f[V]int callback(ALLEGRO_FS_ENTRY * entry, void * extra)\f[R].
The \f[V]callback\f[R] will be called with a pointer to an
ALLEGRO_FS_ENTRY(3) that matches one file or directory in \f[V]dir\f[R],
and the pointer passed in the \f[V]extra\f[R] parameter to
al_for_each_fs_entry(3).
.PP
When \f[V]callback\f[R] returns \f[V]ALLEGRO_FOR_EACH_FS_ENTRY_STOP\f[R]
or \f[V]ALLEGRO_FOR_EACH_FS_ENTRY_ERROR\f[R], iteration will stop
immediately and al_for_each_fs_entry(3) will return the value the
\f[V]callback\f[R] returned.
.PP
When \f[V]callback\f[R] returns \f[V]ALLEGRO_FOR_EACH_FS_ENTRY_OK\f[R]
iteration will continue normally, and if the ALLEGRO_FS_ENTRY(3)
parameter of \f[V]callback\f[R] is a directory, al_for_each_fs_entry(3)
will call itself on that directory.
Therefore the function will recusively descend into that directory.
.PP
However, when \f[V]callback\f[R] returns
\f[V]ALLEGRO_FOR_EACH_FS_ENTRY_SKIP\f[R] iteration will continue, but
al_for_each_fs_entry(3) will NOT recurse into the ALLEGRO_FS_ENTRY(3)
parameter of \f[V]callback\f[R] even if it is a directory.
.PP
This function will skip any files or directories named \f[V].\f[R] or
\f[V]..\f[R] which may exist on certain platforms and may signify the
current and the parent directory.
The \f[V]callback\f[R] will not be called for files or directories with
such a name.
.PP
Returns ALLEGRO_FOR_EACH_FS_ENTRY_OK if successful, or
ALLEGRO_FOR_EACH_FS_ENTRY_ERROR if something went wrong in processing
the directory.
In that case it will use al_set_errno(3) to indicate the type of error
which occurred.
This function returns ALLEGRO_FOR_EACH_FS_ENTRY_STOP in case iteration
was stopped by making \f[V]callback\f[R] return that value.
In this case, al_set_errno(3) will not be used.
