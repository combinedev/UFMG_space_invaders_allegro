.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
An ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_INSTANCE object represents a playable instance of a
predefined sound effect.
It holds information about how the effect should be played: These
playback parameters consist of the looping mode, loop start/end points,
playing position, speed, gain, pan and the playmode.
Whether a sample instance is currently playing or paused is also one of
its properties.
.PP
An instance uses the data from an ALLEGRO_SAMPLE(3) object.
Multiple instances may be created from the same ALLEGRO_SAMPLE.
An ALLEGRO_SAMPLE must not be destroyed while there are instances which
reference it.
.PP
To actually produce audio output, an ALLEGRO_SAMPLE_INSTANCE must be
attached to an ALLEGRO_MIXER(3) which eventually reaches an
ALLEGRO_VOICE(3) object.
